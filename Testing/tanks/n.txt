// clip the incident edge’s points by the first vertex in the reference edge:
// This is done by comparing the offset of the first vertex along
// the reference vector with the incident edge’s offsets.

// the result of the previous clipping operation on the incident edge is
// clipped again using the second vertex of the reference edge.

// Finally, we check if the remaining points are past the reference edge along the reference edge’s normal.
// In all, we perform three clipping operations.
